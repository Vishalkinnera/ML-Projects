# ML-Projects

Machine Learning is the use and development of computer systems that are able to learn and adapt without following explicit instructions, by using algorithms and statistical models to analyze and draw inferences from patterns in data.

Machine Learning has different types. The most used are:-
1) Supervised Learning
2) Unsupervised Learning
3) Reinforcement Learning

The Supervised learning is again divided into Regression and Classification.
In this project, Supervised learning is done.
The Libraries used are:-
1) Numpy, 
2) Pandas, 
3) Matplotlib, 
4) Seaborn, 
5) Sci-Kit Learn

The algorithms used for the projects are:-
1) "XGBoost Regressor" for the Regression problem of "Predicitng the Prices of House."
2) "Logistic Regression" for the Classification problem of "Detecting whether the credit card transaction was fraudulent or not."

The model obtained a good accuracy score.
The Scores were obtained after the Hyper-parameter tuning.
